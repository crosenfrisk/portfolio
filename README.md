### Challenges Faced

I struggled getting flex-box to work for my `.small img items`. I tried creating new divs / containers to better implement the `flex-direction` code in CSS, but something is still off. It was working the morning of December 5, but then I did something that broke it and I haven't been able to fix it before submission. I will try to get it working and resubmit.

### What I Enjoyed

I found the designing of my own portfolio to be a fun project because I liked customizing the CSS. Selecting the color palatte, font style, images, and learning how to format/place everything was enjoyable. I did spend about 40 hours on this project from start to finish.

### Credits

I had lots of help from Google, W3Schools, MDN, and classmates @Metelak and @Kyler-McLachlan (GitHub usernames). I also received feedback from my friend and fellow developer Sarah Marrone [who works with Vivial](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmarrone/).
